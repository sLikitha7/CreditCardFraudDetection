# üîê Credit Card Fraud Detection with Imbalanced Dataset Handling

An end-to-end machine learning project focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced resampling techniques and classification models. This solution addresses the real-world challenge of class imbalance while maximizing detection performance using interpretable and scalable methods.

## ‚úÖ Key Highlights

- Utilized the popular **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset** (~284,807 transactions)
- Performed **data cleaning**, transformation, and **feature engineering**
- Applied **SMOTE** to counter extreme class imbalance (~0.17% fraud)
- Built and compared multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- Evaluated models using **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, and **PR-AUC**
- Incorporated **unsupervised anomaly detection** with Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM
- Visualized performance metrics and **feature importance**
- Packaged into a **modular, reusable Python pipeline**

## üß± Key Components

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed nulls and irrelevant columns
- Engineered features such as `hour`, `normalized_amount`, and `transaction_flag`
- Scaled `Amount` and `Time` using `StandardScaler`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed fraud vs. non-fraud distributions
- Visualized feature relationships using **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**
- Identified high-risk patterns for time-based and amount-based fraud

### 3. Model Building
- Trained supervised classifiers:
  - **Logistic Regression** for baseline interpretability
  - **Random Forest** for ensemble-based robustness
  - **XGBoost** for high-performance gradient boosting
- Included **SMOTE resampling** in the pipeline for minority class balancing

### 4. Anomaly Detection
- Used **Isolation Forest** and **One-Class SVM** to detect fraud in an unsupervised setting
- Compared anomaly scores with known fraud labels

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Precision**: Avoid false accusations
- **Recall**: Catch as many frauds as possible
- **F1-score**: Balanced metric for skewed datasets
- **AUC-ROC & PR-AUC**: Threshold-independent evaluation
